<p>A dome CCTV camera gets its name from the dome-shaped casing that the camera beings in. Whilst these are relatively discreet CCTV cameras in look, this doesn't stop them from preventing crooks.

Rather, you can filter occasion notifications only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more informs, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes.

Oddly, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
