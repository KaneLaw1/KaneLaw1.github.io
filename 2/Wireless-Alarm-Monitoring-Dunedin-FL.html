Frontpoint's detectors are immune to family pets weighing approximately 40 pounds. With ADT, the professional installer can tailor the level of sensitivity level based upon your pet's size.</p>

Tech is supposed to make our lives much easier and Hive's community lives up to that. It's all the function without any disappointment.</p>
