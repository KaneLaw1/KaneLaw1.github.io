<p>We downloaded each camera's app to an iPhone 7, an iPad, and a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie, when possible. The cameras spent weeks protecting our front door, notifying us to good friends, member of the family, delivery individuals, and even the milkman. As soon as we got a sufficient take a look at those friendly faces, we slanted the entire collection external for another two weeks to see what sort of results we would get when the cameras faced the house across the street, which is around 50 feet away.</p>
<p>Windows and door sensors are contact motion sensors that activate an alarm when the protected door or window opens. Like stand-alone motion detectors, these can trigger when you're far from home or whenever you pick. For example, you might keep the window sensing units constantly activated but shut off the door sensors when you're at home. These sensing units can function as part of your security system or by themselves, and they vary in size and design from small, smooth sensing units to large and apparent. Sensors also differ in level of sensitivity. Some might activate when the door or window vibrates versus really opening.</p>
