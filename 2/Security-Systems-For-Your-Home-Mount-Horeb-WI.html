<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus theft, fraud, and vandalism. Tip: Typically keyholders are not readily available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we must once again react to the alarm; each action is billed. Having a keyholder readily available to reset the alarm is one way of getting rid of expensive false alarms. For instance, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a particular level, you can make it automatically shut off the heating systems.

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.
