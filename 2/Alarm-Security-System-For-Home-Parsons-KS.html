<p>Establishing a secure and safe environment for a commercial or residential property is the responsibility of the whole community. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the very first concern you have to ask yourself is just how much storage you will require. The answer hinges on a couple of factors: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video you plan to save and the length of time you plan to keep documented footage. The video is going to consume up storage space rapidly if there are many cameras shooting in a higher resolution. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the earliest footage when you reach the system's capacity, but if you're not careful, the system might overwrite archived video footage that you still require.</p>
