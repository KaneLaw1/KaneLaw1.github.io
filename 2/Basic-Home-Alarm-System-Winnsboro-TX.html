<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras might have the same resolution spec as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much wider location and therefore provides less pixels per inch. Here is what this suggests, by way of an example.

This indicates the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the exact same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread that image across a far larger area and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
