<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Likewise great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
