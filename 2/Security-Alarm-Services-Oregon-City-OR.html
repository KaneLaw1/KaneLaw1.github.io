Simply a couple decades ago, the home security industry was controlled by a few big names using pricey, stiff strategies with little versatility and hostile, long-lasting contracts.

Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will likewise power the security cameras, removing the need for further circuitry. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might require less circuitry in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera separately, usually by means of 110VAC power.</p>

Historically the expenses of these responses have actually been paid by the City's general fund.
