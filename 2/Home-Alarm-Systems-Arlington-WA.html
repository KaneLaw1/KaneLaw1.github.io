<p>Developing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or residential property is the obligation of the whole community. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the first question you need to ask yourself is how much storage you will require. The response depends upon a number of factors: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived footage you mean to keep and how long you plan to keep recorded footage. If there are many cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the video is going to consume storage area quickly.
