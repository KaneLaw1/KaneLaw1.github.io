A keypad can sit by the front door, making it simple to arm and disarm the system. Including Ring Alarm makes sense if you currently own a Ring video doorbell and want to expand your home security protection.

Wireless is the better choice if you want home security that blends into your design and doesn't draw attention to itself. Wireless systems are also ideal for renters because they do not need opening the wall, and can easily be taken with you when you transfer to your next place. If you're seeking to enhance your apartment's security, or just want to watch on your location while you're out, think about installing a portable wireless security system.</p>
