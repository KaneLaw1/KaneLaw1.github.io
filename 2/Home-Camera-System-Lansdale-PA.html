<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that appears to make every effort to make a camera with the most tough setup known to male. Here's how it plays out: First you have to download the app and put in your e-mail address. Then you get in the WiFi information of the network you're trying to connect to. Then the phone plays a screeching, electronic acoustic wave to the camera to transmit the WiFi details. (You must play this at complete volume or it will not work).

<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the extreme environment.</p>

<p>The rest of the field is more specialized, dealing with innovative wise home fanatics or fans of a specific ecosytem of products. Nest's Secure has the very best design of any system I evaluated, consisting of creative things like incorporating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensing units into one unit.

<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, generally described as shock sensing units, are different in that they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling.

Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn produce an alarm condition.</p>
