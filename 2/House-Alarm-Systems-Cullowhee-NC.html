<p>Our burglar alarms might be equipped in the Away" or Stay" mode. Once the alarm system are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to recognize an infraction. As soon as a zone has been broken, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transfers the message through a telephone line.

Going into the code on the alarm system's keypad and switching off the system will end this procedure with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
