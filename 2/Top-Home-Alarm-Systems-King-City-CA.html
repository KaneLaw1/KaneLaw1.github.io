<p>Establishing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or home is the responsibility of the entire community. Storage capability: For video recorders, the very first question you have to ask yourself is how much storage you will require. The response depends upon a couple of aspects: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video you plan to store and how long you plan to keep documented footage. The video is going to consume up storage space quickly if there are numerous cameras shooting in a greater resolution.

<p>Though most of our attention nowadays is concentrated on the shift to IP video technology, it is very important to keep in mind that analog CCTV security cameras can still be highly reliable for numerous surveillance applications, particularly those on a budget plan.
