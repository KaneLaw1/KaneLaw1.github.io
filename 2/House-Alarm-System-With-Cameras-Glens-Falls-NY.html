<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational data to a malicious assaulter, considering that the disruption of the network prevents the circulation of data and really indirectly safeguards data by preventing it from being transmitted. The usual factor for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, during which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, offering a chance for the destructive enemy to record these codes and use different cracking tools to examine security weak points and exploit them to get unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools readily available which can release a dictionary design attack of "potentially accepted" security keys based on the "design" security key recorded throughout the network recovery.</p>
