That spotlight puts it into direct competition with something like the Ring Spotlight Camera Battery, though there's no battery here - you need to wire this approximately a power socket inside (or outside) your home somehow.

Beyond those limits, we typically discovered action missing, thanks to prolonged and irregular spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
