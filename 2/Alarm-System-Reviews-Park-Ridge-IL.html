<p>When using IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will more than likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the big amount of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at really quick speeds, and frequently over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reliable, however not suitable with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the need for additional circuitry. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may require less circuitry in the walls but will still require cables to power the security camera individually, generally through 110VAC power.</p>

If you do buy them, initially check the providers return policy and 2nd keep the invoice.</p>
