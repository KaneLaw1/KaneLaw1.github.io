<p>Another essential topic to discuss is camera resolution. It can be confusing to understand just how much is enough. In this article, the term resolution" refers to the variety of dots (pixels) that comprise a video image; the more dots, the more comprehensive the video image. The exact same holds true of high-resolution TV sets, and the 2 most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution consists of about 4 times as much picture details as 1080p.
