The Netatmo Invite does not have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it constantly asked us to recognize already-identified faces. And in spite of having an appealing price and good efficiency, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has complicated cloud storage that adds $65 to $150 annually to the cost of an otherwise spending plan camera.</p>
