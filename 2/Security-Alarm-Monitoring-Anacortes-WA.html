<p>According to a report, homes that don't have a security system are 3 times most likely to be robbed. With decades of experience monitoring and installing video and audio security systems for Seattle organisations and homes, we've developed excellent relationships with both local police and their consumers. Likewise, do not forget that your wireless network security can be in some cases weak, and susceptible to exploits. It almost doesn't matter how strong your password is or if your software is up to date if cybercriminals can just pirate your Wi-Fi information.

What good is a surveillance camera that just works preferably in best conditions like bright sunlight? Consumer-grade cameras can work well in specific situations such as baby-sitter webcams or signing in on a family pet, though when aiming to gather evidence of a crime they often lose.</p>
