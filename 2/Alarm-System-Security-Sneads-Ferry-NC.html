<h3>Wireless CCTV Camera Sneads Ferry NC 28460</h3>
<p>Smoke and fire alarms alert you if they detect a high-level of smoke or if the temperature level increases too quickly, either of which might suggest a fire. A lot of homes currently have wireless smoke or fire alarms, however you can link the alarm to your security system to add another layer of protection that might save your life or property. If the alarm activates when you're away from home or out of earshot, then any alarms connected to your system will inform you and the security company monitoring your home. The monitoring company can inform you of the trigger and dispatch the fire department.</p>
<p>While all plans include the Frontpoint app, to unlock video surveillance and advanced smart tech functions, you'll need its $50-per-month Ultimate plan. That's a high cost for home automation when compared to rivals like Vivint, which lets you add those features at every tier (beginning at $40 per month). If you select a bundle that doesn't include live video surveillance, think about buying a standalone security camera.
