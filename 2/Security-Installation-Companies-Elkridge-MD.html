The normal reason for performing a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, throughout which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, supplying a chance for the malicious enemy to tape-record these codes and use various splitting tools to examine security weak points and exploit them to acquire unapproved access to the system.

<p>The growing presence of public cameras will bring subtle but extensive changes to the character of our public spaces. When residents are being enjoyed by the authorities - or conscious they might be enjoyed at any time - they are more uneasy and less free-wheeling. As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has pointed out, "understanding that you are being viewed by armed government representatives tends to put a damper on things. You do not wish to anger them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he alerts, "people might learn to be cautious about the periodicals and books they check out in public, avoiding titles that might alarm unseen observers. They might also put more thought into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang druggies, members or hookers." Certainly, the studies of cameras in Britain discovered that people considered to be "out of time and location" with the environments underwent extended surveillance.</p>
