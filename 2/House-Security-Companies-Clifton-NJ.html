Here's a look at Vivint security cameras for outdoor and indoor surveillance. Registered for service for my Simon XTi and was active with their service an hour later. The company that installed my alarm failed so I was on the hunt for a new monitoring company. These people are $18 a month less expensive and stayed in business three decades so I'm comfy providing a try.
