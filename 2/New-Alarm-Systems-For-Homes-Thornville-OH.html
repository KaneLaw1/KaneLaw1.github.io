Central station operators may be instructed to call emergency situation services instantly, or to first call the protected facilities or residential or commercial property manager to try to figure out if the alarm is authentic. Operators might also begin calling a list of phone numbers provided by the consumer to contact somebody to go look at the safeguarded properties. Some zones might trigger a call to the local heating oil company to go check on the system, or a call to the owner with details of which space might be getting flooded.

<p>Cross-zoning is a method that does not require a new keypad. Using multiple sensors to monitor activity in one location, software analyses input from all the sources.

This is also known as the logical option theory (La Vigne et al. 2011).
