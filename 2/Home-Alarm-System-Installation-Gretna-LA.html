<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the same resolution specification as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much larger location and for that reason provides fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this means, by way of an example. Presume 2 cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This indicates the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread that image across a far larger area and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter occasion notifications just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is readily available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The membership is more useful when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals each time you stroll by. Oddly, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
