<p>Linking analog cameras with a DVR system is done by method of directly plugging a BNC cable from the DVR into the camera. To connect more cameras to the DVR system, you need additional cable televisions. DVR systems are difficult to scale up because as soon as every BNC connection is occupied by a camera, you need to buy a completely new DVR before including another camera to the system. DVRs also require that the connected cameras remain in close proximity to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality begins to degrade.</p>
<p>The Maximus Smart Security Light puts a camera right under an ordinary-looking patio light. It's not completely hidden-- it's easy enough to see if you're trying to find it-- however passersby are less likely to notice the Maximus than, state, the Ring Floodlight Camera. Due to the large amount of details about how to buy security cameras that we've included on this page, we have summed up all the data in an infographic, which you can see below. This will help you see at a glance the most essential things you should know before installing security cameras.</p>
<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
