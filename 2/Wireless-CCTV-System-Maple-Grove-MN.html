<p>If you are unsure about whether the wireless CCTV camera type will work in a specific location, a good concept is to examine it with your smart device.

In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance limitations so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR. The biggest disadvantage to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll need to know whether your cameras will be compatible with an offered video recorder before buying.</p>
