<p>B.

Still, you're right about the Arlo Pro not doing anything to keep rain from hitting the lens cover.</p>

(We believe this is a more valuable function if you're positioning the Circle 2 outside, where automobiles regularly pass.) Although having the subscription makes this camera smarter, it's excellent that it's not required, as it is with some cameras, consisting of the Nest Camera.</p>
