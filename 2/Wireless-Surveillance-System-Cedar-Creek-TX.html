In this post, the term resolution" refers to the number of dots (pixels) that comprise a video image; the more dots, the more in-depth the video image. The same is true of high-resolution TV sets, and the 2 most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution consists of about 4 times as much picture information as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also produced in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no. There are some tricky effects to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not always better.</p>
