<p>As an inducement to buy an alarm, a number of companies use "complimentary monitoring services" for the very first couple of months. Numerous insurance companies provide discounts on insurance premiums to clients with operable alarm systems. These discounts might be as much as 20 percent for commercial consumers, and slightly less for residential owners. 16 In addition, numerous cops departments provide several "complimentary" incorrect alarms prior to imposing any fine, despite the fact that the cost to react is significant right from the start. The deals of free monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurance companies bring into question the appropriateness of the current pattern in U.S. policing of allowing three or 4 totally free false alarms per calendar year, because they offer no up-front incentives to encourage owners to avoid false alarms.</p>

It is thought that the increased surveillance offered by CCTV will lower criminal activity and boost arrest, without displacing criminal offense to other nearby areas where CCTV is not in use (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>
