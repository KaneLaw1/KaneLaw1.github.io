<p>Pelco uses video surveillance cameras and video management solutions for commercial environments such as office complexes, shopping hotels, others, and centers. Some people might state that we need to not have surveillance cameras in public places. They claim that they get into personal privacy. The argument here, however, is why be out in public if you desire privacy? Surveillance cameras are meant to keep you and other property safe, not to stalk you. Cameras exist not to invade an individual's personal privacy but to protect the public by hindering criminal activity and by offering product proof when a criminal activity has been caught on movie.</p>
<p>There's no dedicated center involved here - each camera connects straight to your router via Wi-Fi, and streams to your phone (or to the outside world) from there. That's a neat option, or at least one that saves a power socket and an Ethernet port, however we can't help but feel it's also the factor for the Swann's a little sluggish response times. Lots of new security companies are developed for Do It Yourself installation just. ADT stays old-fashioned by setting up each security system themselves.
