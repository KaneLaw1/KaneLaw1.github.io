<p>Note: The above CCTV camera types just touch the IP camera world and leave out the old analog cameras, given that everyone prefers IP cameras today for their budget-friendly prices, features and simple setup.

<p>If you have a larger home or property you want to keep an eye on, SimpliSafe might be too minimal for you. The only outdoor security camera that's presently available is the Video Doorbell Pro, which is great for keeping an eye on visitors and plan shipments, but it leaves other parts of your yard susceptible. If you have a big backyard or sheds to safeguard, this system may not be the best fit. Unlike the outdoor Arlo cameras, the Arlo Q does not require a base station-- it connects directly to any Wi-Fi network. But you can connect the Q with other Arlo indoor and outdoor cameras in the Arlo app, which is readily available for iOS, Android, Fire OS, and any Web internet browser.

<p>For the many part, wireless security equipment is only as noticeable as you want it to be. Window sensing units are quickly hid behind blinds or curtains, and door sensors are so small that they tend to blend into the doorframe. You can conceal a wireless camera much easier than you can one with wires. Wireless is the better option if you want home security that blends into your design and doesn't draw attention to itself. Wireless systems are also ideal for occupants since they don't need opening the wall, and can easily be taken with you when you relocate to your next location. If you're wanting to increase your apartment's security, or simply wish to watch on your place while you're out, consider installing a portable wireless security system.</p>
