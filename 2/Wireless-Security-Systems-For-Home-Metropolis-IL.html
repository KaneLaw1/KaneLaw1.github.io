<h3>Alarm Systems For Business Metropolis IL 62960</h3>

<p>Another important subject to talk about is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to understand just how much is enough. In this short article, the term resolution" refers to the number of dots (pixels) that make up a video image; the more dots, the more comprehensive the video image. The very same is true of high-resolution TV sets, and the two most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about 4 times as much picture details as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also produced in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no. There are some tricky effects to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not always much better.</p>
