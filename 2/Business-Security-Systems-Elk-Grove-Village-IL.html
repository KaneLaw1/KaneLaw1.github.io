<p>Another important subject to discuss is camera resolution. It can be confusing to understand just how much suffices. In this short article, the term resolution" describes the number of dots (pixels) that make up a video picture; the more dots, the more comprehensive the video image. The very same holds true of high-resolution Television Set, and the 2 most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution contains about 4 times as much image information as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are likewise made in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no. There are some challenging consequences to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not always better.</p>
