We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Web Cam (KC120) for one of our top spots. However, neither model has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of as much as 25 seconds in between recordings. The Spot can record as much as 3 minutes without spaces in between clips, however entries were frequently missing, regardless of showing up in the app's activity timeline.
