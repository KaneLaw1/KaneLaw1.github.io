<h3>Home Video Surveillance in Rohnert Park CA</h3>
<p>Unlike conventional alarm systems, which have a control board (generally located in the entryway hall) that is utilized to arm and deactivate the alarm and alert you if any sensing units have actually been triggered, wise alarms are controlled from a smartphone app. The app lets you arm and disarm the alarm, even if you've currently left home, and alerts you if any of the sensing units have actually been set off, instead of getting home to discover your siren has actually been sounding all afternoon (and potentially irritating your neighbours).
