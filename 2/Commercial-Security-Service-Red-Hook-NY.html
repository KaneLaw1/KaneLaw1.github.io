Look at the ceiling of consumer electronic devices shops and storage facility chains and you will observe in each aisle a white dome camera that is bigger than the typical customer camera. Let that sink in for a moment ... these companies do not even utilize the kind of cameras they are selling to the general public, and there is a good reason that.</p>
