<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Likewise good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Need to be a better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
