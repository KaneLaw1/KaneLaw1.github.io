The one time where lag does end up being a little bit of an issue is between tape-recording and detecting movement. Since the Pro 2 does not do constant video recording, it takes a 2nd for the camera to in fact switch on when it detects motion. If a wicked crook was quick enough, they might get past the camera prior to it had time to tape them.

Nevertheless, you will need to pay for extra $2.99 cloud camera storage (per camera) per month, and this doesn't included expert monitoring. This extra cost isn't perfect, however when compared to the Frontpoint and Vivint $40-and $45- respective minimum prices monthly for monitoring, Scout Alarm is a steal.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic but good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
