The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Also nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Need to be a better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.
