<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
