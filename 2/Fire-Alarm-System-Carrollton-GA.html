<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a much better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
