SimpliSafe responded with a statement stating the system would inform users when it detected any kind of disturbance. The company also questioned the video, claiming that there would need to be an ideal storm of circumstances for someone to successfully hack the system.

<h3>Wireless Monitored Home Security System in Illinois</h3>
<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras might have the same resolution spec as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much broader location and therefore uses fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this suggests, by method of an example. Assume two cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This suggests the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image across a far larger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly outstanding on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions.
