<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Likewise good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
