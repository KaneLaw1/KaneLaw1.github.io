<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus scams, theft, and vandalism. Recommendation: Typically keyholders are not offered and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we need to again respond to the alarm; each action is billed. Having a keyholder available to reset the alarm is one method of removing expensive incorrect alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a certain level, you can make it automatically switch off the heater.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially remarkable by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. However if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
