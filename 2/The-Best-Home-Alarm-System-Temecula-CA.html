<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Also good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Need to be a better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>

The app was also painfully slow when we accessed live streams and recorded clips, in addition to when we made modifications in the settings.</p>
