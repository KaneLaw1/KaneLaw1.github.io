<p>Somewhat more expensive than our winning wise alarm, this system was almost as easy to install and, during screening, the loud, clear siren fasted to sound if one of the sensors had been activated. We like that the system includes a wifi security camera and just notifies you when motion is developed by something with the very same heat pattern as a human (ensuring there's no false alerts). Nevertheless, you do need to register for the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 monthly) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get alerts on your phone if the sensors have actually been activated.
