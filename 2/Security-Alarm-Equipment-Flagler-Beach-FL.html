<p>Another important subject to discuss is camera resolution. It can be confusing to comprehend how much suffices.

The exact same holds true of high-resolution Television Set, and the 2 most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about four times as much picture information as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also produced in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no. There are some tricky repercussions to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not constantly better.</p>
