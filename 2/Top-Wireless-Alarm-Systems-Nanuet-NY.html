<p>CR's take: The Wyze Web Cam V2 is a great security camera and a remarkable value. It receives an Exceptional ranking for video quality and is easier to use than the other cameras on this list. It likewise succeeds in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 14 days of free storage for motion-trigged video clips, individual detection, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to keep video footage locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not offer paid subscription prepare for extra cloud storage.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially impressive on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
