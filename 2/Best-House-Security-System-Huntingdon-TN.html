<p>Viewing angle: The camera's field of vision determines how much it can see. As you're most likely monitoring a single space, you want a large viewing angle. Most present cameras fall in the 130-degree variety.

<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens.

Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the severe environment.</p>
