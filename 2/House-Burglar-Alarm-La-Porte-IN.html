The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch of rockets. The innovation slowly developed into the extremely advanced yet economical systems offered today. The first uses of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to tape-record video and watch it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of requirement in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to enhance the outcome of security systems.</p>

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
