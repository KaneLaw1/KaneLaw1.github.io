<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>

However, to save that battery power, recordings max out at simply 10 seconds, with the system leaving a gap of between 12 seconds and 35 seconds from one clip to the next.
