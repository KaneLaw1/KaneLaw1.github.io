<p>Another important topic to talk about is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to understand how much is enough. In this short article, the term resolution" describes the number of dots (pixels) that comprise a video photo; the more dots, the more in-depth the video image. The exact same is true of high-resolution TV sets, and the 2 most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution consists of about four times as much photo information as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also produced in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no.
