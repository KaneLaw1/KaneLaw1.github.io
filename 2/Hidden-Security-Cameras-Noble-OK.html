It likewise does well in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 2 week of free storage for motion-trigged video, individual detection, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to save footage in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not use paid membership plans for extra cloud storage.
