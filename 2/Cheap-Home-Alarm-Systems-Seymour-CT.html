<p>Keep in mind: The above CCTV camera types only touch the IP camera world and overlook the old analog cameras, given that everybody prefers IP cameras today for their affordable prices, features and simple setup.

<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) security protocols were later created to attend to the issues with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or short character string is utilized, WPA and WPA2 can be split. Using an enough time random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 randomly chosen words) makes pre-shared essential WPA practically uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security protocol (WPA2) is based upon the final IEEE 802.11 i change to the 802.11 requirement and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
