<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that appears to strive to make a camera with the most challenging setup understood to guy. Here's how it plays out: First you have to download the app and put in your e-mail address. Then you go into the WiFi details of the network you're attempting to link to. Then the phone plays a piercing, electronic acoustic wave to the camera to transmit the WiFi info. (You must play this at complete volume or it won't work). Windows smash, canines shout, cats scream, babies sob. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the very first ten seconds. It does not work. And it never ever works.</p>
<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly excellent by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. However if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
