<p>We love that the Argus 2 comes with a color night vision option, however the white and black variation can in fact be clearer and offer you higher-quality footage. This isn't really a huge deal thinking about the Argus 2's rate and all its other functions-- however for the record, stick to black and white. With Arlo Pro 3, you'll get 3 months of Arlo smart service. But the coolest feature is that you can charge it with the help of solar power with a solar panel battery charger.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not fantastic-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>
