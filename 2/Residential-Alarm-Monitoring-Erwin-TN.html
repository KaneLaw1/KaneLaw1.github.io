<p>The Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) file encryption requirement was the original file encryption requirement for wireless, but since 2004 with the ratification WPA2 the IEEE has declared it "deprecated", 17 and while often supported, it is rarely or never ever the default on contemporary equipment.

<p>Arlo constructs great home security cameras, and this third-generation Arlo Pro is a prime example of what this company can. While it doesn't have the eye-popping 4K resolution of the Arlo Ultra, it delivers wonderful video quality and a lot of that more-expensive camera's other signature features for less. And it can be deployed inside or out. The Brinks Home Security system comes in two package alternatives. The Home Total design is $29 per month. For those who want to take advantage of higher-end features such as Live Video Streaming and Cloud Video Storage, the monthly charge is $39.</p>
<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly remarkable by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. However if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
