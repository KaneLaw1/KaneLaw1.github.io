<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not terrific-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion activates.</p>

We really delighted in using Nest Secure for home protection and automation, but bear in mind that it can get costly if you don't currently have a Nest wise home ecosystem set up. If you're starting from scratch, we 'd most likely recommend a company like Vivint, ADT, or Frontpoint.</p>

Plus, it works with Nest items, Google Assistant and Amaxon Alexa, and the brand name also offers a series of cameras, sensing units and professional sirens, making it pretty versatile.
