That implies the camera will wait 5 minutes before it's able to tape again, which indicates you might be missing a lot. Wyze's recently introduced Complete Motion Capture resolves this issue for $1.50 each month per camera. It enables recording of all motion the camera senses, for approximately 5 minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and immediately begins another, without any gaps in between. Recordings are easy to find under the Occasions tab at the bottom of the app. Without the subscription, you still get the minimal cloud recording and microSD recording, however we don't advise that for home security because if it's stolen, you don't have a backup.</p>
