Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more informs, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When utilized in high-traffic areas, the membership is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals every time you walk by.
