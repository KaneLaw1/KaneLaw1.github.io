<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against vandalism, fraud, and theft. Idea: Frequently keyholders are not readily available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we should again respond to the alarm; each action is billed. Having a keyholder readily available to reset the alarm is one way of removing expensive false alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a specific level, you can make it immediately shut off the heater. If the motion sensors are set off, you can immediately make the clever lights turn on to frighten possible burglars.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic but good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have horrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>
