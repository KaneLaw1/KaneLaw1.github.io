<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Likewise great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Should be a better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
