Like any invasive innovation, the benefits of releasing public camera need to be stabilized against the dangers and costs. This technology (a) has the possible modification the core experience of going out in public in America due to the fact that of its chilling impact on residents, (b) brings very genuine dangers of abuse and "mission creep," and (c) would not significantly secure us against terrorism.
