There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is linked to the exact same network as the NVR.

<p>Most contemporary CCTV video surveillance systems include DVRs (digital video recorders) which enable operators to gain some of the benefits of a network-based surveillance setup. DVRs transform the analog video footage to digital, which assists to extend storage capability, makes it much easier to search archived video footage, and also permits users to stream video over a network for remote watching from multiple locations. Frequently, the simple existence of security cameras can scare away less-motivated intruders. However keeping them hidden and out of sight can keep them from being damaged or harmed by the more identified burglars. If intruders can not see any security cameras, they might likewise be less careful about covering their faces and their tracks.</p>
