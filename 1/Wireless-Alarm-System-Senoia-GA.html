<p>The NVR removes these issues, since it is instead connected straight to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the same network, usually by method of a PoE switch, are then able to send video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely since they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can send video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance restrictions so long as a camera is linked to the exact same network as the NVR. The largest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.

Your cost savings might be as high as 15-20 percent when you have a burglar and smoke alarm system monitored by a UL-Listed main monitoring station. All of the innovation based security hardware work hand in hand with the control panels in a house to communicate all messages to the monitoring company.
