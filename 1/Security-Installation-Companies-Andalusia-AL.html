<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we could point them at the exact same area and expose them all to the same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting components, which I had actually installed on the patio by a licensed electrical contractor (who happens to be my hubby).
