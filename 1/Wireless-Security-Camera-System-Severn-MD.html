It is geared up with a PIR (Passive Infrared) Motion Sensing unit, so whenever there's some motion detected, it can send you a push notice in your phone so you can react to it right away. Furthermore, the motion sensor here is far more advanced than the ones provided by adobe Starter Set. Considering that it is a PIR motion sensor, it only gets activated when it catches motion from something releasing infrared energy, i.e., animals and people.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
