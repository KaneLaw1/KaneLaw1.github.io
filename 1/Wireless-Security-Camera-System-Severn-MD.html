<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
