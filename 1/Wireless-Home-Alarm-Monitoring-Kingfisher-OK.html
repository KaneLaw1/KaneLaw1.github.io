If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and instantly begins another, without any spaces in between. Recordings are easy to find under the Events tab at the bottom of the app. Without the subscription, you still get the limited cloud recording and microSD recording, but we do not recommend that for home security because if it's taken, you do not have a backup.</p>
