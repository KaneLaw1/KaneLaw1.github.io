CCTV is likewise grounded in situational criminal activity prevention strategy, which argues that opportunities to offend can be decreased by changing a variety of mechanisms such as increasing the danger of a wrongdoer being nabbed, increasing the effort to commit the crime, decreasing rewards from criminal offense commission, and minimizing justifications that trigger criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011).

There's a regular monthly monitoring fee that normally ranges in between $15-40 a month.</p>
