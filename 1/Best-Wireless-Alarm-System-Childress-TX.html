In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can send footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the exact same network as the NVR. The largest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll need to know whether your cameras will be compatible with a given video recorder prior to buying.</p>
