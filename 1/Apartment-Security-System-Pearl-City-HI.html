<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter occasion notices just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is readily available just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent informs whenever you stroll by.
