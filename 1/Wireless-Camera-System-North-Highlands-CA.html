<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Likewise great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Must be a much better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
