<p>The Google Nest Webcam IQ Outdoor is the most technologically innovative outdoor camera we have actually evaluated. It has a close-up tracking feature, which instantly focuses on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high dynamic variety), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between basic motion and individuals, so it cuts down on false alarms, and it can even recognize individuals you have actually identified (after a learning period). But like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>
<p>The Nest Cam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were remarkable in our screening-- throughout the day and during the night-- with a large, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video. We must note that the camera would occasionally downgrade the photo quality based upon available bandwidth, which might change throughout the day. Nest consists of the option to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, however that may beat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>
