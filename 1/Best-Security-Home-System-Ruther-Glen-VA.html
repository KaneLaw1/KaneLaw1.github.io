<p>While it strikes the resolution, we think there's a little interpolation on its 4K video considered that the Arlo Ultra's recordings can tend to be a little smeary when zoomed right in, but this is still far and away the sharpest security camera we have actually seen in action, wireless or otherwise. Keep an eye on what matters by streaming your security camera on your TELEVISION using Google Nest or Home speaker or screen and Chromecast or a TELEVISION with Chromecast built-in.</p>
