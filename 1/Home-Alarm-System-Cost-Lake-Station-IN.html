<p>C. False Burglar Alarm. Make the purchase online for UL Central Station Alarm Monitoring. If using 4G LTE cellular or IP Internet, Select either landline or the proper interactive service. Select billing period: Yearly or month-to-month. We get a 15% prepay discount rate from our UL central station provider which we hand down to our yearly customers. This is NOT a contract, rather an annual prepay discount rate. When I eventually entered into the camera controls, I was reasonably impressed. The camera quality isn't half bad, there's a strong night-vision mode, and all the app controls are fairly self-explanatory. You've got two-way audio, you can play tunes just to let the person being viewed know they're being seen, and you can select to tape-record video clips or pictures and save them to your wise gadget on an impulse.</p>
