<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Also nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Should be a better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.
