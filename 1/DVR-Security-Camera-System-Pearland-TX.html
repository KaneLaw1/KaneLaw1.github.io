Abode has upgraded that variation with 4G cellular backup and an onboard Z-Wave 500 Series chip, which supplies a much better range for sensing units. Both the original Abode system and the House Iota work with Alexa, Google Assistant, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and more, but the Iota is the only design we tested that likewise deals with HomeKit. We have actually encountered a couple of technical issues while long-term testing the Abode Iota, and so will continue to check and update appropriately. We no longer recommend it.</p>
