As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely typical given that the entrance and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
