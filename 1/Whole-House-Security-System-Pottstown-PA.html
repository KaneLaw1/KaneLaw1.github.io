In addition to monitoring your home's activity with door sensing units and motion detection, many home security systems also support cameras, either inside or outside your home.

<p>Besides resolution, also consider the field of vision. All security cameras have wide-angle lenses, but not all angles are created equivalent. Depending on the lens' field of view, it can see between 100 and 180 degrees. That's a big variety in terms of the camera's vision cone. If you want to enjoy a large area, you need to think about a camera with a really wide field of view. The capability to mechanically pan and tilt the camera is a great property also.</p>

Today's systems can be modified and expanded as essential. There are several choices for night vision cameras available. The majority of them are economical yet highly practical. Go for designs that take advantage of infrared (IR) technology if you're looking for night vision cameras that supply the brightest and best night view. Some designs are created to trigger the IR innovation automatically depending on the light conditions. In addition, ensure the camera has 100 feet of night vision or more.</p>
