<p>CR's take: The Wyze Camera V2 is a great security camera and an incredible value. It gets an Exceptional rating for video quality and is easier to use than the other cameras on this list. It also succeeds in our privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 2 week of totally free storage for motion-trigged video clips, individual detection, voice control by means of Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to keep video locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not use paid membership plans for additional cloud storage.

Without the service or an SD card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>
<p>SimpliSafe might be too limited for you if you have a bigger home or residential or commercial property you want to keep an eye on.
