<p>CR's take: The Wyze Cam V2 is a great security camera and a remarkable value. It receives an Outstanding rating for video quality and is much easier to utilize than the other cameras on this list. It also does well in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 14 days of complimentary storage for motion-trigged video, person detection, voice control via Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to keep video footage in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not provide paid subscription plans for additional cloud storage. But the company does use a Complete Motion Capture service that continuously records for as long as motion is found. Without an sd or the service card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>
