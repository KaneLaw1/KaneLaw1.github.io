<p>Pelco uses video surveillance cameras and video management services for commercial environments such as office complexes, shopping others, hotels, and centers. Some individuals might state that we need to not have surveillance cameras in public locations. They claim that they attack personal privacy. The argument here, however, is why be out in public if you want personal privacy? Surveillance cameras are suggested to keep you and other residential or commercial property safe, not to stalk you. Cameras are there not to attack an individual's privacy but to protect the public by deterring criminal activity and by supplying material proof when a criminal activity has been caught on movie.</p>

<p>So what happens if something triggers your alarm but you're in a meeting with a vendor and you do not get the alert?
