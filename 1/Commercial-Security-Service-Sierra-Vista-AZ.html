<p>Megapixel Cameras Now Readily Available. ASecureLife's recommendation: Go to Ring for a well-priced Do It Yourself system that you can self-monitor or get expertly monitored for a small fee. We recommend the eight-piece kit due to the fact that it includes several windows and door sensors for complete coverage. We likewise advise adding a doorbell camera at some time.

<p>TP-Link's Kasa Web cam Outdoor (KC200) has 1080p images and a 130-degree field of view that might equal some of our top choices. It also includes 2 days of free cloud storage (with an alternative for more ), which can pack in clips of up to 3 minutes. Nevertheless, we had a handful of tests where recordings cut out in the middle of the action and would leave 13-second gaps in between clips.

Surveillance cameras are also made in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no.
