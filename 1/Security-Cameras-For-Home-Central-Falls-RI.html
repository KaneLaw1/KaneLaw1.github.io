The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology slowly progressed into the highly advanced yet inexpensive systems available today.

<p>Some wireless home security systems use a video recording storage choice and others do not. For the ones that do not, you are able to see a live video feed of your home any time you access your system; however, absolutely nothing is tape-recorded. The systems with video storage typically include either a local storage or cloud storage choice. A local storage alternative saves a pre-determined number of video clips on the device itself. This choice is generally cost-free. A cloud storage choice conserves your video clips in the cloud. However, this is typically a paid service and the variety of hours it will save will depend upon just how much cloud storage you want to pay for.</p>
