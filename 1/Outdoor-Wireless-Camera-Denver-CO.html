These discounts might be as much as 20 percent for commercial consumers, and slightly less for residential owners. 16 In addition, many authorities departments use a number of "complimentary" false alarms prior to enforcing any fine, despite the fact that the cost to react is significant right from the start. The offers of complimentary monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurance companies bring into question the suitability of the existing pattern in U.S. policing of permitting three or 4 complimentary incorrect alarms per fiscal year, since they provide no up-front incentives to encourage owners to avoid incorrect alarms.</p>

<p>We tried to find Do It Yourself systems that provided professional monitoring, both with and without an agreement. Although some companies offer heavily reduced or free hardware in exchange for a service commitment that can last anywhere from one to five years, we found no-contract systems to be the most versatile. Some individuals may wish to register for service just for when they or their partner is out of town, for example. No-contract systems also cost less in the long run and enable you to be in total control of the equipment you utilize, in addition to how and when you utilize and pay for monitoring services.</p>

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. But if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
