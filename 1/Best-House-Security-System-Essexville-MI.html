<p>The implicit reason for the current push to increase video surveillance is the hazard of terrorist attacks. However suicide opponents are clearly not deterred by camera - and may even be brought in to the tv coverage cameras can guarantee - and the cost of a substantial video surveillance system such as Britain's - which draws up roughly 20 percent of that country's criminal justice budget - far surpasses the restricted benefits that the system might offer in examining attacks or attempted attacks after the reality (see reality sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that seems to make every effort to make a camera with the most difficult setup understood to guy.

Then the phone plays a screeching, electronic acoustic wave to the camera to transfer the WiFi information. (You should play this at full volume or it won't work). Windows smash, dogs wail, cats shriek, children cry. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the first 10 seconds. It does not work. And it never ever works.</p>
