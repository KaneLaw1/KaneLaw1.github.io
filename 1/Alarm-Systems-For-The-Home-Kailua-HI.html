It receives an Outstanding ranking for video quality and is simpler to utilize than the other cameras on this list. It also does well in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 14 days of complimentary storage for motion-trigged video clips, individual detection, voice control via Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to save footage locally on an SD card.
