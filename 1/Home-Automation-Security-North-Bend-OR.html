<h3>Residential Home Security in Oregon</h3>
<p>Amongst IP security choices, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras collect and send data over a wireless network. These security cameras link to a user's home wifi network and enables that user to see the footage from anywhere. A typical mistaken belief is that wireless indicates the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras may still require a power cable. Wired security cameras are linked to a recorder straight which then links to a router and the web. Lastly, wire-free cameras are completely cable television complimentary and battery powered. Although battery replacements are needed, these are the easiest option to install and all of the recorded video is kept in the cloud.</p>

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.
