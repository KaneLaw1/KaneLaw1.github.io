<p>The rest of the field is more specialized, catering to innovative smart home fanatics or fans of a particular ecosytem of products. Nest's Secure has the very best design of any system I evaluated, consisting of creative things like integrating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensing units into one unit. However the Secure is expensive, additional sensors are costly, and the monitoring service-- which doesn't include emergency alarm or camera backups-- is likewise pricey if you do not dedicate to a three-year agreement.</p>
<p>The motion detection is excellent, and the app is a pleasure to utilize as well (a lot better than the apps you get with some budget security cameras), though if you wish to enter its cleverest customisations, there is a little bit of a knowing curve.
