<p>So, while alarm may have some benefit for alarm owners as part of a total security plan, the question stays whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood ought to shoulder a share of the cost. If alarm use led to boosted public safety-- that is, alarms led to much higher burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, fewer robberies across an entire jurisdiction-- its public value would be more evident. Nevertheless, the truth that alarm calls are overwhelmingly incorrect and do not contribute significantly to authorities capability to apprehend robbers makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by authorities and whole neighborhoods (all taxpayers subsidize police action to alarmed properties) a expensive and inefficient  technique to robbery decrease across an entire jurisdiction.</p>
