Elements we considered consisted of the quality of the security cameras (do they have motion detection and night vision?), exists a monitoring strategy, can window sensors and door sensors be incorporated, whether the system had a mobile app, can it work with your door locks and can it be included into an existing wise home setup, consisting of with voice commands via Amazon Alexa.</p>
