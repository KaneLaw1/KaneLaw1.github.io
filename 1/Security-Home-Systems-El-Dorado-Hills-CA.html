Here is what this suggests, by way of an example. Presume two cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This suggests the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the exact same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image throughout a far bigger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>

The one major benefit of 4K resolution is the ability to deal with detail after the truth, which suggests that users can focus on information such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. However, while 4K resolution provides some benefits, it likewise brings with it some drawbacks. 4K images are huge and take up a lot of taping storage space.
