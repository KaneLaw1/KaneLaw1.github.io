Nest's Secure has the very best style of any system I tested, consisting of clever things like incorporating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensing units into one system.

Practically all self monitored alarm systems use protection from intrusions and robberies in the type of motion and entry sensing units.
