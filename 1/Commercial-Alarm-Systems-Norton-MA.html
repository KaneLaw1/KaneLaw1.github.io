<p>Closed circuit tv (CCTV) surveillance is a type of situational crime prevention developed to avoid both personal and residential or commercial property criminal offense and can be used in location of, or in addition to, police. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and transfer images of a particular location of interest and are either monitored from another location by security personnel or preprogramed to scan the defined location (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is thought that the increased surveillance supplied by CCTV will lower crime and increase arrest, without displacing criminal offense to other close-by locations where CCTV is not in usage (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>

<p>So, while alarm might have some advantage for alarm owners as part of an overall security plan, the concern remains whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood must take on a share of the cost. If alarm usage led to enhanced public safety-- that is, alarms caused much greater burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, less robberies throughout an entire jurisdiction-- its public value would be more apparent. However, the truth that alarm calls are extremely incorrect and do not contribute substantially to police capability to apprehend burglars makes the underwriting of alarm response by police and whole communities (all taxpayers subsidize police reaction to alarmed properties) a ineffective and expensive technique to burglary decrease across an entire jurisdiction.</p>
<p>I am writing in gratitude and to share with you my current experience with National Security Service. Bear in mind that you might not need to buy new equipment at all.

Clients have the option to buy the equipment or lease (which includes a lifetime warranty).

<p>A lot of contemporary CCTV video surveillance systems include DVRs (digital video recorders) which allow operators to gain a few of the advantages of a network-based surveillance setup. DVRs convert the analog video footage to digital, which assists to extend storage capability, makes it a lot easier to search archived video, and likewise allows users to stream video over a network for remote viewing from several places. Often, the mere presence of security cameras can frighten less-motivated trespassers. However keeping them hidden and out of sight can keep them from being tampered with or damaged by the more determined intruders. They might also be less cautious about covering their faces and their tracks if burglars can not see any security cameras.</p>
