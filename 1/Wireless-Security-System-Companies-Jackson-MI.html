<p>Our alarm systems may be armed in the Away" or Stay" mode. Once the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to acknowledge an infraction. When a zone has actually been broken, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and sends the message through a telephone line. When the signal is gotten, the intruder alarm system will wait to send out another message if another zone is tripped. Getting in the code on the alarm system's keypad and turning off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
