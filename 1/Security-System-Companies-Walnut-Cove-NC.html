<p>CCTV cameras are put in areas where they are believed to be most reliable, which usually includes extremely inhabited towns, town hall, car parks, or various other high-crime locations (Welsh and Farrington 2008). Given that the placement of these cameras is very important, the criminal activity patterns in locations of interest are usually studied for time periods to recognize criminal activity hotspots where cameras might possibly be positioned.
