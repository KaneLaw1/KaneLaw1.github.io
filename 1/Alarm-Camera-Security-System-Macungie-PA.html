<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>

Here's a take a look at Vivint security cameras for indoor and outdoor surveillance. Signed up for service for my Simon XTi and was active with their service an hour later. The company that installed my alarm failed so I was on the hunt for a new monitoring company. These people are $18 a month less expensive and been in business 3 decades so I'm comfortable providing a try. Wish I had actually looked earlier but honestly didnt recognize I might conserve money up until forced to look when my dealer folded.</p>
