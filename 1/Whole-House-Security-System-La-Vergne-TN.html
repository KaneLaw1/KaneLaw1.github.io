<p>The Nest Cam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were impressive in our testing-- throughout the day and during the night-- with a wide, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that permitted us to get a closer view in live video. We ought to note that the camera would occasionally downgrade the image quality based upon readily available bandwidth, which might vary throughout the day.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic however good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky.
