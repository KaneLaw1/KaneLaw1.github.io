<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly remarkable by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
