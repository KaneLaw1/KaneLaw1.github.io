<p>When I speak about my work with homeland security surveillance and physical security technologies, I usually get the Big Brother is viewing" remark, referring to George Orwell's omnipresent socialistic watcher called Big Brother in his book 1984. This Orwellian" fear is that somebody someplace may be seeing you through a video surveillance camera this very minute and that someone somewhere is abusing the system to break your freedom and personal privacy.
