<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against vandalism, fraud, and theft. Idea: Typically keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we should again respond to the alarm; each action is billed. Having a keyholder offered to reset the alarm is one way of getting rid of pricey incorrect alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a particular level, you can make it automatically switch off the heater. You can automatically make the wise lights turn on to scare away prospective robbers if the motion sensing units are set off.</p>
