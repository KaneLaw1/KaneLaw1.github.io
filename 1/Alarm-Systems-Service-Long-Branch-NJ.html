<p>There are even absolutely wireless clever cameras, which run for weeks of batteries, and so can be set up anywhere without stressing over drilling holes for wiring at all. ADT Blue is a camera-heavy, Do It Yourself variation of the ADT system, and we like its cameras better than the traditional" ADT versions.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly remarkable on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features.
