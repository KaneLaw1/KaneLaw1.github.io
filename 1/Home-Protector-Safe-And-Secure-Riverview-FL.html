They can track a person or a vehicle throughout a range, or be set to cycle through different orientations to give you a far more comprehensive field of view with a single piece of hardware.

<p>Aside from good Wi-Fi, you may likewise need a neighboring outlet. Many cameras require an AC connection, which indicates you will not be able to put them just anywhere.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially outstanding by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
