<p>Unlike most other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter event notifications just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is more useful when utilized in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts every time you stroll by. Unusually, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
