<h3>CCTV Home Security in Michigan</h3>
<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational information to a malicious attacker, since the disturbance of the network avoids the flow of information and in fact indirectly secures data by avoiding it from being transmitted. The usual factor for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, during which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, offering an opportunity for the malicious assaulter to tape these codes and use various cracking tools to analyze security weaknesses and exploit them to get unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools readily available which can launch a dictionary design attack of "perhaps accepted" security keys based on the "design" security crucial caught throughout the network recovery.</p>
