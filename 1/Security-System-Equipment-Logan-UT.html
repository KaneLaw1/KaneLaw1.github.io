Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the membership is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid notifies each time you stroll by.
