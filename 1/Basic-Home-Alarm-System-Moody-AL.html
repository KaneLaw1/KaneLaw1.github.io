As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everyone getting in the shop.

Sadly, once customers realize that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's typically far too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
