<h3>Security System Alarm in La Grange TX</h3>
<p>so say you have a camera that someone can see it they would shoot it if they had a weapon so I suggest to have cameras built in to a house that will be pertected by cameras. Box cameras provide an apparent sign for anyone who passes by that they are being taped on CCTV and this can be a fantastic deterrent of theft and criminal offense.

<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Likewise great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
