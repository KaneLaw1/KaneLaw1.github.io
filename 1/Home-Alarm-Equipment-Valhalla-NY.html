<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
