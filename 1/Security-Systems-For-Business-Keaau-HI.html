<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Also nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>
