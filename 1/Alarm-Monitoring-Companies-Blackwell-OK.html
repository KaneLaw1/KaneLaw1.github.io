ADT doesn't have the greatest customer care track record amongst the companies we considered, racking up more than 3,000 complaints on its Better Business Bureau page While we chalked the majority of this approximately the truth that ADT has a number of million more customers than its competitors, our tester started his call with low expectations.</p>
