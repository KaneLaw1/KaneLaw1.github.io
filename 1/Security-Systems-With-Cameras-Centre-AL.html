Regrettably, throughout 2002 a Maryland professor discovered some drawbacks citation required Over the next few years these drawbacks were resolved with using TLS and other improvements. 26 This new variation of EAP is now called Prolonged EAP and is available in a number of versions; these consist of: EAP-MD5, PEAPv0, PEAPv1, EAP-MSCHAPv2, LEAP, EAP-FAST, EAP-TLS, EAP-SIM, mschapv2, and eap-ttls.</p>
