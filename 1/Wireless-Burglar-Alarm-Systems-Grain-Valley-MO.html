<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Likewise good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Must be a much better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening.
