Many local security companies like Alarm New England have the ability to recycle most, if not all, of your existing security system.

<p>At home consultations are sales chances for security companies. These assessments can be incredibly valuable, but they can also sell you on a lot of equipment you didn't think you required (and most likely still don't).

Although the cameras reviewed in this guide do have basic security functions, they can't replace a full home security system, that includes door and window and motion sensing units, smoke alarm, and so on.</p>
