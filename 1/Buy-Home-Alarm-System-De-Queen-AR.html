<p>Our alarm systems might be armed in the Away" or Stay" mode. As soon as the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the capability to recognize a violation. When a zone has been breached, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and sends the message through a telephone line.

Going into the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and switching off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
