Nest's Secure has the very best design of any system I evaluated, consisting of smart things like incorporating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensing units into one system. But the Secure is pricey, extra sensors are expensive, and the monitoring service-- which doesn't include smoke alarm or camera backups-- is also costly if you do not devote to a three-year contract.</p>
