<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. For instance, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies developed their equipment by doing this to make clients stick with them longer, due to the fact that changing monitoring companies implies hundreds of dollars down the drain and a substantial headache for consumers.
