<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus theft, scams, and vandalism. Tip: Often keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset. We should again react to the alarm; each response is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates. Having a keyholder available to reset the alarm is one method of removing expensive false alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a certain level, you can make it immediately shut off the heating systems. If the motion sensors are activated, you can immediately make the smart lights turn on to scare away prospective robbers.</p>
