<p>The growing presence of public cameras will bring profound but subtle modifications to the character of our public spaces. When people are being watched by the authorities - or aware they may be enjoyed at any time - they are more awkward and less free-wheeling. As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has mentioned, "understanding that you are being seen by armed government agents tends to deter things. You don't wish to offend them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he cautions, "individuals may find out to be careful about the regulars and books they read in public, avoiding titles that might alarm unseen observers. They may likewise put more thought into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang members, drug addicts or hookers."

<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, normally described as shock sensing units, are different in that they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Generally, the most intense frequencies generated are between 3 and 5 kHz, depending on the type of glass and the presence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn generate an alarm condition.</p>
