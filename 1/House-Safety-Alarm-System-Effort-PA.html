Commercial-grade cameras are created and built for high-performance applications where failure is not an option; consumer-grade cameras are not. Generally, consumer-grade cameras are developed to work well when there is lots of readily available light, and once the lighting ends up being missing or low (believe sundown or nighttime), their pedigree starts to reveal. Due to the fact that they have bigger internal video sensing units and higher-quality elements that can adapt and catch exceptional low light video, commercial cameras exceed their cheaper cousins.</p>
