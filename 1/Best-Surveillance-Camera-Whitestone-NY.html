The usual reason for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, throughout which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, providing an opportunity for the destructive aggressor to tape-record these codes and utilize numerous breaking tools to examine security weak points and exploit them to acquire unauthorized access to the system.
