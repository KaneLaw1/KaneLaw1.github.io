She was very efficient and had the service set up for us within hours. Lt. Gregory was really responsive to all of our demands. I will highly suggest your services to anyone that requires short-lived security. We will absolutely be in touch needs to we require these services once again. On the disadvantage, installation is demanding, and you'll need to drill plenty of holes to accommodate all the circuitry. If you're leasing, this might not be practical. If you're planning to move house any time soon, wired systems are likewise inflexible so not a sensible move.</p>
