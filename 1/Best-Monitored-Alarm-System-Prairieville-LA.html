<p>The disadvantage to a wireless system is that it depends on a wireless signal, implying that storms and strong winds have the power to disrupt the system and could even set off false alarms.

<p>Info used for home security alarm system contrasts was obtained November 2016 through telephone and online research study.

Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
