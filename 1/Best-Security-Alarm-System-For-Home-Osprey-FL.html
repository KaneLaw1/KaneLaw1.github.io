<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Likewise good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
