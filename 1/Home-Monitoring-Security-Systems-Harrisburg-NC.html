We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Webcam (KC120) for one of our top areas. Nevertheless, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of approximately 25 seconds in between recordings.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy.
