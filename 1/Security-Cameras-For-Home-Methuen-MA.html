<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Likewise great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
<p>A system that requires a contract might be a wise choice for those who are cash-strapped or don't want to spend for the equipment up-front. Why? Because contract-based security systems typically do not come with upfront fees. Rather, the costs are spread out over the length of the agreement. We've seen 1-year, all the method as much as 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we recommend contract-free systems if you do not wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term arrangement (and who does?). Our pick: No contract.</p>
