As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally regular given that the entrance and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
